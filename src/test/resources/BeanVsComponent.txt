@Component

Definition: @Component is a class-level annotation that indicates that a class is a Spring-managed component.
It is used for automatic component scanning and is typically applied to classes that are part of the applicationâ€™s business logic,
such as services, repositories, and controllers.

Usage: When a class is annotated with @Component, Spring automatically detects it during component scanning and registers
it as a bean in the application context. This means that instances of the class will be created and managed by Spring.

Subclassing: There are specialized versions of @Component, such as @Service, @Repository, and @Controller,
which indicate the role of the bean in the application. These annotations are semantically similar to @Component,
but they provide additional clarity and may have some extra behavior (like exception translation for @Repository).

@Bean

Definition: @Bean is a method-level annotation that indicates that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
It is used inside a @Configuration class to explicitly declare a bean.

Usage: When you annotate a method with @Bean, Spring will call this method to obtain the instance of the bean,
and the return value of the method will be registered as a bean in the application context.
This allows for more explicit configuration of the bean (e.g., setting properties or using third-party libraries).

Flexibility: Using @Bean is useful when you need to configure a bean in a specific way or when the class does not
have the @Component annotation and cannot be detected through component scanning.

When to Use Which

    Use @Component when you want to let Spring automatically detect and manage your classes,
    especially when building large applications where many components are involved.

    Use @Bean when you want more explicit control over the creation and configuration of a bean,
    particularly when you need to set up complex objects or use third-party libraries that do not use Spring annotations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

Both @Component and @Bean are essential tools for creating and managing beans in a Spring application.
Understanding their differences helps you choose the right approach based on your specific requirements and design preferences.

Key Differences
Feature	                @Component	                                            @Bean
Level	                Class-level annotation	                                Method-level annotation
Purpose	                Used for auto-detection of classes as beans	            Used to explicitly declare a bean and its configuration
Context	                Can be used on any class to make it a bean	            Must be used within a @Configuration class
Component Scanning	    Automatically registered during component scanning	    Explicitly declared; not automatically scanned
Configuration Control	Less control over the instantiation process	            Full control over how the bean is created
Specialization	        Specialized variants like @Service, @Repository, etc.	No specialized versions; every bean is defined at the method level
